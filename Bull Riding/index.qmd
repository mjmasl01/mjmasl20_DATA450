#### About the data

A data frame for 38 riders from the 2023 season of the Professional Bull Riding (PBR) league, for the Touring Pro Division. These data frames hold the stats for the riders and the bulls they ride. The data was scraped from the PBR website. For the rider data set, there are 357 riders with 16 variables, however, not all of the riders points meaning they would not hold a lot of significance in data and may skew the results. The bull data set has 50 bulls with 11 variables on their scoring statistics.

### Questions

`1.` What are the most significant predictors of a bull rider's final points?

`2.` What is the stronger model for predicting PBR's final points?

`3.` Are there any outliers or a potential influential point? How would we handle these point(s)?

`4.` If we want to create a new variable in the PBR dataset, how would we do that?

### Questions

`1.` What are the most significant predictors of a bull rider's final points?

`2.` What is the stronger model for predicting PBR's final points?

`3.` Are there any outliers or a potential influential point? How would we handle these point(s)?

`4.` If we want to create a new variable in the PBR dataset, how would we do that?

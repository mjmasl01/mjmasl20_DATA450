# Questions from Module

## 1. What are the most significant predictors of a bull rider's final points?

```{r}
riders %>%
  select(-Rider) %>%
  lm(Points ~ ., data = .) %>%
  summary()
```




## 2 What is the stronger model for predicting PBRâ€™s points?

```{r}
riders %>%
lm(Points ~ `Points` + Events + Outs + Rides + prop.Ridden + `Highest RideScore` + `Round Wins` + `Event Wins` ,
   data = .) %>%
  summary()


riders %>%
lm(Points ~  Events + prop.Ridden + `Highest RideScore` + `Round Wins` + `Event Wins` ,
   data = .) %>%
  summary()
```
```{r}
modFull <- lm(Points ~ Events + Outs + Rides + prop.Ridden + `Highest RideScore` + `Round Wins` + `Event Wins` , data = riders)
modRed <- lm(Points ~  Events + prop.Ridden + `Highest RideScore` + `Round Wins` + `Event Wins` , data = riders)
anova(modRed, modFull) %>% tidy()
```




*Given what every model was better from a above......
## 3 Are there any outliers or a potential influential point? How would we handle these point(s)?

```{r}
library(modelr)
grid <-riders %>% data_grid(
  Events = seq_range(riders$Events, n = 5),
  Outs = seq_range(riders$Outs, n = 5),
  Rides = seq_range(riders$Rides, n = 5),
  prop.Ridden = seq_range(riders$prop.Ridden, n = 5),
  `Highest RideScore` = seq_range(riders$`Highest RideScore`, n = 5),
  `Round Wins` = seq_range(riders$`Round Wins`, n = 5),
  `Event Wins` = seq_range(riders$`Event Wins`, n = 5)
  
)
aug_rider <- augment(modFull, newdata = grid, se_fit = TRUE, interval = "prediction")
aug_rider
```
```{r}
aug_rider %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = as.factor(chol)), size=1.5) +
  geom_rug(data = riders, sides = "t", alpha = 0.3,
           aes(y = Points)) +
  geom_rug(data = riders, sides = "b", alpha = 0.3,
           aes(y = Points)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Predicted Probability of Heart Disease by Age, Cholesterol, and Sex",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Predicted Probability of Heart Disease",
       color = "Cholesterol Level")
```



# 4 If we want to create a new variable in the PBR dataset, how would we do that?
